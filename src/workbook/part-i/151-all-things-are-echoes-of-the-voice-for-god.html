<p id=p1>No one can judge on partial evidence. 
²That is not judgment. 
³It is merely an opinion based on ignorance and doubt. 
⁴Its seeming certainty is but a cloak for the uncertainty it would conceal. 
⁵It needs irrational defense because it is irrational. 
⁶And its defense seems strong, convincing, and without a doubt because of all the doubting underneath.</p>

²You do not really question what is shown you through the body’s eyes. 
³Nor do you ask why you believe it, even though you learned a long while since your senses do deceive. 
⁴That you believe them to the last detail which they report is even stranger, when you pause to recollect how frequently they have been faulty witnesses indeed! 
⁵Why would you trust them so implicitly? 
⁶Why but because of underlying doubt, which you would hide with show of certainty?</p>

²Your judgment rests upon the witness that your senses offer you. 
³Yet witness never falser was than this. 
⁴But how else do you judge the world you see? 
⁵You place pathetic faith in what your eyes and ears report. 
⁶You think your fingers touch reality, and close upon the truth. 
⁷This is awareness that you understand, and think more real than what is witnessed to by the eternal Voice for God Himself.</p>

⁵It guides your senses carefully, to prove how weak you are; how helpless and afraid, how apprehensive of just punishment, how black with sin, how wretched in your guilt.</p>

<p id=p13>We practice wordlessly today, except at the beginning of the time we spend with God. ²We introduce these times with but a single, slow repeating of the thought with which the day begins. ³And then we watch our thoughts, appealing silently to Him Who sees the elements of truth in them. ⁴Let Him evaluate each thought that comes to mind, remove the elements of dreams, and give them back again as clean ideas that do not contradict the Will of God.</p>

<p id=p14>Give Him your thoughts, and He will give them back as miracles which joyously proclaim the wholeness and the happiness God wills His Son, as proof of His eternal Love. ²And as each thought is thus transformed, it takes on healing power from the Mind which saw the truth in it, and failed to be deceived by what was falsely added. ³All the threads of fantasy are gone. ⁴And what remains is unified into a perfect Thought that offers its perfection everywhere.</p>

<p id="p15">15.

<p id="p16">Such is your Eastertide. ²And so you lay the gift of snow-white lilies on the world, replacing witnesses to sin and death. ³Through your transfiguration is the world redeemed, and joyfully released from guilt. ⁴Now do we lift our resurrected minds in gladness and in gratitude to Him Who has restored our sanity to us.</p>

<p id="p17">And we will hourly remember Him Who is salvation and deliverance. ²As we give thanks, the world unites with us and happily accepts our holy thoughts, which Heaven has corrected and made pure. ³Now has our ministry begun at last, to carry round the world the joyous news that truth has no illusions, and the peace of God, through us, belongs to everyone.</p>
