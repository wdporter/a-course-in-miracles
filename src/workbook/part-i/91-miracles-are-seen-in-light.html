1. It is important to remember that miracles and vision necessarily go together. 
²This needs repeating, and frequent repeating. 
³It is a central idea in your new thought system, and the perception that it produces. 
⁴The miracle is always there. 
⁵Its presence is not caused by your vision; its absence is not the result of your failure to see. 
⁶It is only your awareness of miracles that is affected. 
⁷You will see them in the light; you will not see them in the dark.

Miracles are always there whether you see them or not. You see miracles in 
light.

2. To you, then, light is crucial. 
²While you remain in darkness, the miracle remains unseen. 
³Thus you are convinced it is not there. 
⁴This follows from the premises from which the darkness comes. 
⁵Denial of light leads to failure to perceive it. 
⁶Failure to perceive light is to perceive darkness. 
⁷The light is useless to you then, even though it is there. 
⁸You cannot use it because its presence is unknown to you. 
⁹And the seeming reality of the darkness makes the idea of light meaningless.

You cannot see miracles in darkness. If you deny light you will remain in 
darkness.

3. To be told that what you do not see is there sounds like insanity. 
²It is very difficult to become convinced that it is insanity not to see what is there, and to see what is not there instead. 
³You do not doubt that the body’s eyes can see. 
⁴You do not doubt the images they show you are reality. 
⁵Your faith lies in the darkness, not the light. 
⁶How can this be reversed? 
⁷For you it is impossible, but you are not alone in this.

The body’s eyes see darkness. What the body’s eyes show you is not there. But you have put your faith in them. You need to put your faith in light.

Jesus gazed at them. “For men”, he said, “it is impossible, but not for God: 
because everything is possible for God”. —Mark 10:27

4. Your efforts, however little they may be, have strong support. 
²Did you but realize how great this strength, your doubts would vanish. 
³Today we will devote ourselves to the attempt to let you feel this strength. 
⁴When you have felt the strength in you, which makes all miracles within your easy reach, you will not doubt. 
⁵The miracles your sense of weakness hides will leap into awareness as you feel the strength in you.
</p>

<p id="p5">
5. Three times today, set aside about ten minutes for a quiet time in which you try to leave your weakness behind. 
²This is accomplished very simply, as you instruct yourself that you are not a body. 
³Faith goes to what you want, and you instruct your mind accordingly. 
⁴Your will remains your teacher, and your will has all the strength to do what it desires. 
⁵You can escape the body if you choose. 
⁶You can experience the strength in you.
</p>

<p id="p6">
6. Begin the longer practice periods with this statement of true cause and effect relationships:
</p>

<blockquote>
²Miracles are seen in light.<br />
³The body’s eyes do not perceive the light.<br />
⁴But I am not a body. 
⁵What am I?
</blockquote>

<p>
⁶The question with which this statement ends is needed for our exercises today. 
⁷What you think you are is a belief to be undone. 
⁸But what you really are must be revealed to you. 
⁹The belief you are a body calls for correction, being a mistake. 
¹⁰The truth of what you are calls on the strength in you to bring to your awareness what the mistake conceals.

<p id="p7">
7. If you are not a body, what are you? 
²You need to be aware of what the Holy Spirit uses to replace the image of a body in your mind. 
³You need to feel something to put your faith in, as you lift it from the body. 
⁴You need a real experience of something else, something more solid and more sure; more worthy of your faith, and really there.
</p>

<p id="p8">
8. If you are not a body, what are you? 
²Ask this in honesty, and then devote several minutes to allowing your mistaken thoughts about your attributes to be corrected, and their opposites to take their place. 
³Say, for example:
</p>

<blockquote>
⁴I am not weak, but strong.<br />
⁵I am not helpless, but all powerful.<br />
⁶I am not limited, but unlimited.<br />
⁷I am not doubtful, but certain.<br />
⁸I am not an illusion, but a reality.<br />
⁹I cannot see in darkness, but in light.
</blockquote>

<p id="p9">
9. In the second phase of the exercise period, try to experience these truths about yourself. 
²Concentrate particularly on the experience of strength. 
³Remember that all sense of weakness is associated with the belief you are a body, a belief that is mistaken and deserves no faith. 
⁴Try to remove your faith from it, if only for a moment. 
⁵You will be accustomed to keeping faith with the more worthy in you as we go along.
</p>

<p id="p10">
10. Relax for the rest of the practice period, confident that your efforts, however meager, are fully supported by the strength of God and all His Thoughts. 
²It is from Them that your strength will come. 
³It is through Their strong support that you will feel the strength in you. 
⁴They are united with you in this practice period, in which you share a purpose like Their Own. 
⁵Theirs is the light in which you will see miracles, because Their strength is yours. 
⁶Their strength becomes your eyes, that you may see.
</p>

<p id="p11">
11. Five or six times an hour, at reasonably regular intervals, remind yourself that miracles are seen in light. 
²Also, be sure to meet temptation with today’s idea. 
³This form would be helpful for this special purpose:
</p>

<blockquote>
⁴Miracles are seen in light. 
⁵Let me not close my eyes because of this. 
</blockquote>
