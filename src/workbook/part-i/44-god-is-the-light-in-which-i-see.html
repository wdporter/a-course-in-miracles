Today we are continuing the idea for yesterday, adding another dimension to it. 
²You cannot see in darkness, and you cannot make light. 
³You can make darkness and then think you see in it, but light reflects life, and is therefore an aspect of creation. 
⁴Creation and darkness cannot coexist, but light and life must go together, being but different aspects of creation.

Today we are continuing the idea for yesterday, adding another dimension to 
it. ²You cannot see in darkness, and you cannot make light. ³You can make 
darkness and then think you see in it [darkness], but light reflects life, and 
is therefore an aspect of creation. ⁴Creation and darkness cannot coexist, but 
light and life must go together, being but [only] different aspects of 
creation.
</p>

<p>
You make darkness and you think you can see in the darkness
Creation includes light and life.

2. In order to see, you must recognize that light is within, not without. 
²You do not see outside yourself, nor is the equipment for seeing outside you. 
³An essential part of this equipment is the light that makes seeing possible. 
⁴It is with you always, making vision possible in every circumstance.

do not see outside yourself, nor is the equipment for seeing outside you. 
³An essential part of this equipment [the equipment for seeing] is the light 
that makes seeing possible. ⁴It [the light that makes seeing possible] is with

<p>
The light by which you see is inside you. It is always there so vision is always possible.

3. Today we are going to attempt to reach that light. 
²For this purpose, we will use a form of exercise which has been suggested before, and which we will utilize increasingly. 
³It is a particularly difficult form for the undisciplined mind, and represents a major goal of mind training. 
⁴It requires precisely what the untrained mind lacks. ⁵Yet this training must be accomplished if you are to see.
</p>

<p id="p4">
4. Have at least three practice periods today, each lasting three to five minutes. 
²A longer time is highly recommended, but only if you find the time slipping by with little or no sense of strain. 
³The form of practice we will use today is the most natural and easy one in the world for the trained mind, just as it seems to be the most unnatural and difficult for the untrained mind.
</p>

<p id="5">
5. Your mind is no longer wholly untrained. 
²You are quite ready to learn the form of exercise we will use today, but you may find that you will encounter strong resistance. 
³The reason is very simple. 
⁴While you practice in this way, you leave behind everything that you now believe, and all the thoughts that you have made up. 
⁵Properly speaking, this is the release from hell. ⁶Yet perceived through the ego’s eyes, it is loss of identity and a descent into hell.
</p>

<p id="p6">
6. If you can stand aside from the ego by ever so little, you will have no difficulty in recognizing that its opposition and its fears are meaningless. 
²You might find it helpful to remind yourself, from time to time, that to reach light is to escape from darkness, whatever you may believe to the contrary. 
³God is the light in which you see. 
⁴You are attempting to reach Him.
</p>


<p id="p7">
7. Begin the practice period by repeating today’s idea with your eyes open, and close them slowly, repeating the idea several times more. 
²Then try to sink into your mind, letting go every kind of interference and intrusion by quietly sinking past them. 
³Your mind cannot be stopped in this unless you choose to stop it. 
⁴It is merely taking its natural course. 
⁵Try to observe your passing thoughts without involvement, and slip quietly by them.
</p>

<p id="p8">
8. While no particular approach is advocated for this form of exercise, what is needful is a sense of the importance of what you are doing; its inestimable value to you, and an awareness that you are attempting something very holy. 
²Salvation is your happiest accomplishment. 
³It is also the only one that has any meaning, because it is the only one that has any real use to you at all.
</p>

<p id="p9">
9. If resistance rises in any form, pause long enough to repeat today’s idea, keeping your eyes closed unless you are aware of fear. 
²In that case, you will probably find it more reassuring to open your eyes briefly. 
³Try, however, to return to the exercises with eyes closed as soon as possible.
</p>

<p id="p10">
10. If you are doing the exercises correctly, you should experience some sense of relaxation, and even a feeling that you are approaching, if not actually entering into light. 
²Try to think of light, formless and without limit, as you pass by the thoughts of this world. 
³And do not forget that they cannot hold you to the world unless you give them the power to do so.
</p>

<p id="p11">
11. Throughout the day repeat the idea often, with eyes open or closed as seems better to you at the time. ²But do not forget. ³Above all, be determined not to forget today.
