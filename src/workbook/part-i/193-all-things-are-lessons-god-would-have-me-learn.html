10. We will attempt today to overcome a thousand seeming obstacles to peace in just one day. 
²Let mercy come to you more quickly. 
³Do not try to hold it off another day, another minute or another instant. 
⁴Time was made for this. 
⁵Use it today for what its purpose is. 
⁶Morning and night, devote what time you can to serve its proper aim, and do not let the time be less than meets your deepest need.
</p>

<p id="p11">
11. Give all you can, and give a little more. 
²For now we would arise in haste and go unto our Father’s house. 
³We have been gone too long, and we would linger here no more. 
⁴And as we practice, let us think about all things we saved to settle by ourselves, and kept apart from healing. 
⁵Let us give them all to Him Who knows the way to look upon them so that they will disappear. 
⁶Truth is His message; truth His teaching is. 
⁷His are the lessons God would have us learn.

12. Each hour, spend a little time today, and in the days to come, in practicing the lesson in forgiveness in the form established for the day. 
²And try to give it application to the happenings the hour brought, so that the next one is free of the one before. 
³The chains of time are easily unloosened in this way. 
⁴Let no one hour cast its shadow on the one that follows, and when that one goes, let everything that happened in its course go with it. 
⁵Thus will you remain unbound, in peace eternal in the world of time.

<p id="p13">
13. This is the lesson God would have you learn: There is a way to look on everything that lets it be to you another step to Him, and to salvation of the world. 
²To all that speaks of terror, answer thus:
</p>

<blockquote>
³I will forgive, and this will disappear.
</blockquote>

<p>
⁴To every apprehension, every care and every form of suffering, repeat these selfsame words. 
⁵And then you hold the key that opens Heaven’s gate, and brings the Love of God the Father down to earth at last, to raise it up to Heaven. 
⁶God will take this final step Himself. 
⁷Do not deny the little steps He asks you take to Him.
