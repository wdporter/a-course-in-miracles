1. You have surely noticed an emphasis throughout our recent lessons on the connection between fulfilling your function and achieving happiness. 
²This is because you do not really see the connection. 
³Yet there is more than just a connection between them; they are the same. 
⁴Their forms are different, but their content is completely one.

1. You have surely noticed an emphasis throughout our recent lessons on the 
connection between fulfilling your function and achieving happiness. ²This [we 
emphasize the connection] is because you do not really see the connection 
[between between fulfilling your function and achieving happiness]. ³Yet there 
is more than just a connection between them [fulfilling your function and 
achieving happiness]; they [fulfilling your function and achieving happiness] 
are the same. ⁴Their [fulfilling your function’s; achieving happiness’s] forms 
are different, but their [fulfilling your function’s; achieving happiness’s] 
content is completely one. 
</details>

<details><summary>Summarized</summary>
Fullfilling your function and achieving happiness are the same.

2. The ego does constant battle with the Holy Spirit on the fundamental question of what your function is. 
²So does it do constant battle with the Holy Spirit about what your happiness is. 
³It is not a two-way battle. 
⁴The ego attacks and the Holy Spirit does not respond. 
⁵He knows what your function is. 
⁶He knows that it is your happiness.

2. The ego does constant battle with the Holy Spirit on the fundamental 
question of what your function is. ²So does it [the ego] do constant battle 
with the Holy Spirit about what your happiness is. ³It [the ego’s battle] is 
not a two-way battle. ⁴The ego attacks and the Holy Spirit does not respond. 
⁵He [the Holy Spirit] knows what your function is. ⁶He [the Holy Spirit] knows 
that it [your function] is your happiness. 
</details>

<details><summary>Summarized</summary>
The ego battles the Holy Spirit over your happiness and your function. The 
Holy Spirit does not respond. The Holy Spirit knows what your happiness and 
function is.

3. Today we will try to go past this wholly meaningless battle and arrive at the truth about your function. 
²We will not engage in senseless arguments about what it is. 
³We will not become hopelessly involved in defining happiness and determining the means for achieving it. 
⁴We will not indulge the ego by listening to its attacks on truth. 
⁵We will merely be glad that we can find out what truth is. 

<p id=p4>
4. Our longer practice period today has as its purpose your acceptance of the fact that not only is there a very real connection between the function God gave you and your happiness, but that they are actually identical. 
²God gives you only happiness. 
³Therefore, the function He gave you must be happiness, even if it appears to be different. 
⁴Today’s exercises are an attempt to go beyond these differences in appearance, and recognize a common content where it exists in truth.

<p id=p5>
5. Begin the ten-to-fifteen-minute practice period by reviewing these thoughts:

<blockquote>
²God gives me only happiness. <br>
³He has given my function to me. <br>
⁴Therefore my function must be happiness. <br>
</blockquote>

<p>
⁵Try to see the logic in this sequence, even if you do not yet accept the conclusion. 
⁶It is only if the first two thoughts are wrong that the conclusion could be false. 
⁷Let us, then, think about the premises for a while, as we are practicing. 

<p id=p6>
6. The first premise is that God gives you only happiness. 
²This could be false, of course, but in order to be false it is necessary to define God as something He is not. 
³Love cannot give evil, and what is not happiness is evil. 
⁴God cannot give what He does not have, and He cannot have what He is not. 
⁵Unless God gives you only happiness, He must be evil. 
⁶And it is this definition of Him you are believing if you do not accept the first premise.

you only happiness] could be false, of course, but in order to be false it is 
necessary to define God as something He [God] is not. ³Love cannot give evil, 
and what is not happiness is evil. ⁴God cannot give what He [God] does not

only happiness, He [God] must be evil. ⁶And it is this definition of Him [God 
is evil] you are believing if you do not accept the first premise.

<details><summary>Summarized</summary>
God cannot give evil.

7. The second premise is that God has given you your function. 
²We have seen that there are only two parts of your mind. 
³One is ruled by the ego, and is made up of illusions. 
⁴The other is the home of the Holy Spirit, where truth abides. 
⁵There are no other guides but these to choose between, and no other outcomes possible as a result of your choice but the fear that the ego always engenders, and the love that the Holy Spirit always offers to replace it.

as a result of your choice but the fear that the ego always engenders, and the 
love that the Holy Spirit always offers to replace it [fear]. 
</details>

<details><summary>Summarized</summary>
One part of your mind is the ego which is illusions resulting in fear. The 
other part is the Holy Spirit which replaces fear with love.

8. Thus, it must be that your function is established by God through His Voice, or is made by the ego which you have made to replace Him. 
²Which is true? 
³Unless God gave your function to you, it must be the gift of the ego. 
⁴Does the ego really have gifts to give, being itself an illusion and offering only the illusion of gifts?

gave your function to you, it [your function] must be the gift of the ego.

illusion and offering only the illusion of gifts?

The ego cannot give gifts. The gift of your function must come from God.

9. Think about this during the longer practice period today. 
²Think also about the many forms the illusion of your function has taken in your mind, and the many ways in which you tried to find salvation under the ego’s guidance. 
³Did you find it? 
⁴Were you happy? 
⁵Did they bring you peace? 
⁶We need great honesty today. 
⁷Remember the outcomes fairly, and consider also whether it was ever reasonable to expect happiness from anything the ego ever proposed. 
⁸Yet the ego is the only alternative to the Holy Spirit’s Voice.

10. You will listen to madness or hear the truth. 
²Try to make this choice as you think about the premises on which our conclusion rests. 
³We can share in this conclusion, but in no other. 
⁴For God Himself shares it with us. 
⁵Today’s idea is another giant stride in the perception of the same as the same, and the different as different. 
⁶On one side stand all illusions. 
⁷All truth stands on the other. 
⁸Let us try today to realize that only the truth is true.

<p id=p11>
11. In the shorter practice periods, which would be most helpful today if undertaken twice an hour, this form of the application is suggested:

<blockquote>
²My happiness and function are one, because God has given me both.
</blockquote>

<p>
³It will not take more than a minute, and probably less, to repeat these words slowly and think about them a little while as you say them.
