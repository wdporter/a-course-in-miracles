1. Father, You are the One Who gave the plan for my salvation to me. 
²You have set the way I am to go, the role to take, and every step in my appointed path. 
³I cannot lose the way. 
⁴I can but choose to wander off a while, and then return. 
⁵Your loving Voice will always call me back, and guide my feet aright. 
⁶My brothers all can follow in the way I lead them. 
⁷Yet I merely follow in the way to You, as You direct me and would have me go.
</i></p>

<p id="p2">
2. So let us follow One Who knows the way. 
²We need not tarry, and we cannot stray except an instant from His loving Hand. 
³We walk together, for we follow Him. 
⁴And it is He Who makes the ending sure, and guarantees a safe returning home.
