Christ’s Second Coming gives the Son of God this gift: to hear the Voice for God proclaim that what is false is false, and what is true has never changed. 
²And this the judgment is in which perception ends. 
³At first you see a world that has accepted this as true, projected from a now corrected mind. 
⁴And with this holy sight, perception gives a silent blessing and then disappears, its goal accomplished and its mission done.

2. The final judgment on the world contains no condemnation. 
²For it sees the world as totally forgiven, without sin and wholly purposeless. 
³Without a cause, and now without a function in Christ’s sight, it merely slips away to nothingness. 
⁴There it was born, and there it ends as well. 
⁵And all the figures in the dream in which the world began go with it. 
⁶Bodies now are useless, and will therefore fade away, because the Son of God is limitless.

²To fear God’s saving grace is but to fear complete release from suffering, return to peace, security and happiness, and union with your own Identity.

You thought judgment meant condemnation. But it means God’s final correction of all errors. There can be no effects of error either. To be afraid of correction is to be afraid of release, peace, security, happiness and to be afraid of who you are.
