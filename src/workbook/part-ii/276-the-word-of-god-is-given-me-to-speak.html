1. What is the Word of God? 
²“My Son is pure and holy as Myself”. 
³And thus did God become the Father of the Son He loves, for thus was he created. 
⁴This the Word His Son did not create with Him, because in this His Son was born. 
⁵Let us accept His Fatherhood, and all is given us. 
⁶Deny we were created in His Love and we deny our Self, to be unsure of who we are, of Who our Father is, and for what purpose we have come. 
⁷And yet, we need but to acknowledge Him Who gave His Word to us in our creation, to remember Him and so recall our Self.
