1. Father, I come to You today to seek the peace that You alone can give. 
²I come in silence. 
³In the quiet of my heart, the deep recesses of my mind, I wait and listen for Your Voice. 
⁴My Father, speak to me today. 
⁵I come to hear Your Voice in silence and in certainty and love, sure You will hear my call and answer me.

2. Now do we wait in quiet. 
²God is here, because we wait together. 
³I am sure that He will speak to you, and you will hear. 
⁴Accept my confidence, for it is yours. 
⁵Our minds are joined. 
⁶We wait with one intent: to hear our Father’s answer to our call, to let our thoughts be still and find His peace, to hear Him speak to us of what we are, and to reveal Himself unto His Son.
