1. God is with me. 
²He is my Source of life, the life within, the air I breathe, the food by which I am sustained, the water which renews and cleanses me. 
³He is my home, wherein I live and move; the Spirit which directs my actions, offers me Its Thoughts, and guarantees my safety from all pain. 
⁴He covers me with kindness and with care, and holds in love the Son He shines upon, who also shines on Him. 
⁵How still is he who knows the truth of what He speaks today!

as we come quietly into Your Presence now, and ask to rest with You in peace a
