<p>Humankind, all of us, was created whole and perfect by an infinite intelligence, an eternal being of Love and Light — God.</p>

<p>This Perfect Creation is the Christ.</p>

<p>Love and Light are the energy and substance of God and the created Christ: us.</p>

<p>God and the Christ are eternal, they are the all that exists.</p>

<p>Everything else is an illusion.</p>

<hr />

<p>Into this reality, where all was one, a false idea came into the mind of the Christ,<br>
 the idea that the Christ could somehow exist without there being a Creator.</p>

<p>This false idea is not a problem, the problem arose<br>
 when the creation took the idea seriously and forgot to laugh at it.</p>

<p>That was the original “sin” or the original “mistake”.</p>

<p>The force of this mistake was so seemingly powerful,<br>
 that the Christ Mind literally “knocked itself out”. It put itself to sleep.
</p>

<p>The creation now became lost in the nightmare it was having while asleep.</p>

<p>This nightmare, is the three-dimensional world of time and space<br>
 we appear to find ourselves in.
</p>

<p>Since this world is based on the thought that we could cut ourselves off<br>
 from light and life, in it are the dark illusions of sickness, death and war.</p>

<p>This is a world of total illusion. Nothing in it is “real”.</p>

<hr />

<p>However, since we are all still connected to God,<br>
 there is still a Voice for God in our minds.
</p>

<p>This Voice is the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>There is another voice that tells us our illusions are true and<br>
 that we are separate, isolated entities. This other voice is the ego.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is in a continual process of correcting our thinking.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit has a correction for every ego thought of separation.</p>

<p>This process of correcting the ego is called the Atonement.</p>

<p>Once we learn, through the Holy Spirit’s help,<br>
 that we are dreaming the world we think we are in, we can change the dream.
</p>

<p>Through true forgiveness and non-judgment we correct, or atone for,<br>
 the separation idea we forgot to laugh at and our minds start to heal.</p>

<p>The world we now see begins to reflect our healing minds.</p>

<p>The dark illusions of sickness, death and war start to heal.</p>

<p>The world becomes happier and healthier and more full of light.</p>

<p>We call this healed existence the “real world” because it is closer to reality.</p>

<hr />

<p>Finally, when the mind is totally healed, our Creator, God, wakes us up and<br>
 this illusion of what never was simply ceases to be.</p>
