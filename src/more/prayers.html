<h2>From the Ur-Text</h2>

<p>I would like to pray that my will be united with yours, recognising that your perfect love will suffice (or correct) for my imperfect love. </p>

<p>I pray that I may accept the Atonement with conviction, recognising its inevitable worth, and my own divine worth as part of this identification with you. </p>

<p>I pray that my fear be replaced by an active sense of your love, and your continual willingness to help me overcome the split, or divided will, which is responsible for my difficulty with this. </p>

<p>I accept the divinity of the messages we have received, and affirm my will in both accepting and acting upon the Atonement principle.</p>

<p>Here I am.</p>

<h2>Perfect Love Casts out Fear</h2>

<p>Perfect love casts out fear.<br />
If fear exists,<br />
Then there is not perfect love.</p>

<p>Only perfect love exists.<br />
If there is fear,<br />
It produces a state that does not exist.<br />

I am content to be wherever He wishes, knowing He goes there with me.<br />
I will be healed as I let Him teach me to heal.<br />

<h2>I Must Have Decided Wrongly</h2>
