1. Indeed, yes! 
²No one can escape God’s Final Judgment. 
³Who could flee forever from the truth? 
⁴But the Final Judgment will not come until it is no longer associated with fear. 
⁵One day each one will welcome it, and on that very day it will be given him. 
⁶He will hear his sinlessness proclaimed around and around the world, setting it free as God’s Final Judgment on him is received. 
⁷This is the Judgment in which salvation lies. 
⁸This is the Judgment that will set him free. 
⁹This is the Judgment in which all things are freed with him. 
¹⁰Time pauses as eternity comes near, and silence lies across the world that everyone may hear this Judgment of the Son of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
¹¹Holy are you, eternal, free and whole, at peace forever in the Heart of God. 
¹²Where is the world, and where is sorrow now?

1. Indeed, yes! ²No one can escape God’s Final Judgment. ³Who could flee 
forever from the truth? ⁴But the Final Judgment will not come until it [the 
Final Judgment] is no longer associated with fear. ⁵One day each one will 
welcome it [the Final Judgment], and on that very day it [the Final Judgment] 
will be given him [to each one]. ⁶He [each one] will hear his [each-one’s] 
sinlessness proclaimed around and around the world, setting it [the world] 
free as God’s Final Judgment on him [each one] is received. ⁷This [the 
judgment of sinlessness] is the Judgment in which salvation lies. ⁸This [the 
judgment of sinlessness] is the Judgment that will set him [each one] free. 
⁹This [the judgment of sinlessness] is the Judgment in which all things are 
freed with him [each one]. ¹⁰Time pauses as eternity comes near, and silence

 “Do not judge, and you will not be judged; because the judgments you give are 
the judgments you will get, and the amount you measure out is the amount you 
will be given. Why do you observe the splinter in your brother’s eye and 
never notice the plank in your own? How dare you say to your brother, ‘Let me 
take the splinter out of your eye’, when all the time there is a plank in your 
own? Hypocrite! Take the plank out of your own eye first, and then you will 
see clearly enough to take the splinter out of your brother’s eye.” 
(Matthew 7:1–5)

2. Is this your judgment on yourself, teacher of God? 
²Do you believe that this is wholly true? 
³No; not yet, not yet. 
⁴But this is still your goal; why you are here. 
⁵It is your function to prepare yourself to hear this Judgment and to recognize that it is true. 
⁶One instant of complete belief in this, and you will go beyond belief to Certainty. 
⁷One instant out of time can bring time’s end. 
⁸Judge not, for you but judge yourself, and thus delay this Final Judgment. 
⁹What is your judgment of the world, teacher of God? 
¹⁰Have you yet learned to stand aside and hear the Voice of Judgment in yourself? 
¹¹Or do you still attempt to take His role from Him? 
¹²Learn to be quiet, for His Voice is heard in stillness. 
¹³And His Judgment comes to all who stand aside in quiet listening, and wait for Him.

Judgment is God’s role. Judgment is not your role. Your role is to prepare 
yourself for a judgment of sinlessness. Learn to accept this judgment for 
yourself.

3. You who are sometimes sad and sometimes angry; who sometimes feel your just due is not given you, and your best efforts meet with lack of appreciation and even contempt; give up these foolish thoughts! 
²They are too small and meaningless to occupy your holy mind an instant longer. 
³God’s Judgment waits for you to set you free. 
⁴What can the world hold out to you, regardless of your judgments on its gifts, that you would rather have? 
⁵You will be judged, and judged in fairness and in honesty. 
⁶There is no deceit in God. 
⁷His promises are sure. 
⁸Only remember that. 
⁹His promises have guaranteed His Judgment, and His alone, will be accepted in the end. 
¹⁰It is your function to make that end be soon. 
¹¹It is your function to hold it to your heart, and offer it to all the world to keep it safe.
