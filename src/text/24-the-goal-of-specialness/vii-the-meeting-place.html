1. How bitterly does everyone tied to this world defend the specialness he wants to be the truth! 
²His wish is law to him, and he obeys. 
³Nothing his specialness demands does he withhold. 
⁴Nothing it needs does he deny to what he loves. 
⁵And while it calls to him he hears no other Voice. 
⁶No effort is too great, no cost too much, no price too dear to save his specialness from the least slight, the tiniest attack, the whispered doubt, the hint of threat, or anything but deepest reverence. 
⁷This is your son, beloved of you as you are to your Father. 
⁸Yet it stands in place of your creations, who <i>are </i> son to you, that you might share the Fatherhood of God, not snatch it from Him. 
⁹What is this son that you have made to be your strength? 
¹⁰What is this child of earth on whom such love is lavished? 
¹¹What is this parody of God’s creation that takes the place of yours? 
¹²And where are they, now that the host of God has found another son whom he prefers to them?

⁷Whatever is perceived as means for truth shares in its holiness, and rests in light as safely as itself.
