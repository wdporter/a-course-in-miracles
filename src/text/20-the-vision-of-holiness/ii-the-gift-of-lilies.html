2. Gifts are not made through bodies, if they be truly given and received. 
²For bodies can neither offer nor accept; hold out nor take. 
³Only the mind can value, and only the mind decides on what it would receive and give. 
⁴And every gift it offers depends on what it wants. 
⁵It will adorn its chosen home most carefully, making it ready to receive the gifts it wants by offering them to those who come unto its chosen home, or those it would attract to it. 
⁶And there they will exchange their gifts, offering and receiving what their minds judge to be worthy of them.

Offering thorns to any one part of the Sonship is offering them to all and to 
me. Be sure you haven’t offered thorns to me. Offering thorns is an offer of 
separation while you believe you are a body. However you are not a body and 
your altar is not what you thought it was.

²You <i>have</i> forgiven me.
