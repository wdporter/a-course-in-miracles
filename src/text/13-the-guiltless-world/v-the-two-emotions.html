1. I have said you have but two emotions, love and fear. 
²One is changeless but continually exchanged, being offered by the eternal to the eternal. 
³In this exchange it is extended, for it increases as it is given. 
⁴The other has many forms, for the content of individual illusions differs greatly. 
⁵Yet they have one thing in common: they are all insane. 
⁶They are made of sights that are not seen, and sounds that are not heard. 
⁷They make up a private world that cannot be shared. 
⁸For they are meaningful only to their maker, and so they have no meaning at all. 
⁹In this world their maker moves alone, for only he perceives them.

There are only two emotions, love and fear. Love does not change. The eternal 
extends love by exchanging love. We make illusions out of the things we see 
and hear. We live in private worlds of illusion that make us fearful.

2. Each one peoples his world with figures from his individual past, and it is because of this that private worlds do differ. 
²Yet the figures that he sees were never real, for they are made up only of his reactions to his brothers, and do not include their reactions to him. 
³Therefore, he does not see he made them, and that they are not whole. 
⁴For these figures have no witnesses, being perceived in one separate mind only.

3. It is through these strange and shadowy figures that the insane relate to their insane world. 
²For they see only those who remind them of these images, and it is to them that they relate. 
³Thus do they communicate with those who are not there, and it is they who answer them. 
⁴And no one hears their answer save him who called upon them, and he alone believes they answered him. 
⁵Projection makes perception, and you cannot see beyond it. 
⁶Again and again have you attacked your brother, because you saw in him a shadow figure in your private world. 
⁷And thus it is you must attack yourself first, for what you attack is not in others. 
⁸Its only reality is in your own mind, and by attacking others you are literally attacking what is not there.

… the first twenty-five [lessons] specifically aim at the beginning of the 
process of correcting or undoing our faulty perceptions. Emphasis is also 
placed in these early lessons upon the cause–effect relationship that exists 
between our thoughts and our perceptions, reflecting the the text’s principle: 
“projection makes perception”. (see also <a

4. The delusional can be very destructive, for they do not recognize they have condemned themselves. 
²They do not wish to die, yet they will not let condemnation go. 
³And so they separate into their private worlds, where everything is disordered, and where what is within appears to be without. 
⁴Yet what is within they do not see, for the reality of their brothers they cannot recognize.

5. You have but two emotions, yet in your private world you react to each of them as though it were the other. 
²For love cannot abide in a world apart, where when it comes it is not recognized. 
³If you see your own hatred as your brother, you are not seeing him. 
⁴Everyone draws nigh unto what he loves, and recoils from what he fears. 
⁵And you react with fear to love, and draw away from it. 
⁶Yet fear attracts you, and believing it is love, you call it to yourself. 
⁷Your private world is filled with figures of fear you have invited into it, and all the love your brothers offer you, you do not see.

love as if it was fear, and recoil from it. If you see your own hatred as your

6. As you look with open eyes upon your world, it must occur to you that you have withdrawn into insanity. 
²You see what is not there, and you hear what makes no sound. 
³Your manifestations of emotions are the opposite of what the emotions are. 
⁴You communicate with no one, and you are as isolated from reality as if you were alone in all the universe. 
⁵In your madness you overlook reality completely, and you see only your own split mind everywhere you look. 
⁶God calls you and you do not hear, for you are preoccupied with your own voice. 
⁷And the vision of Christ is not in your sight, for you look upon yourself alone.

²For if you offer it to yourself, you <em>are</em> offering it to Him. 
³And He will not return it, for it is unworthy of you because it is unworthy of Him. 
⁴Yet He would release you from it and set you free. 
⁵His sane Answer tells you what you have offered yourself is not true, but His offering to you has never changed. 
⁶You who know not what you do can learn what insanity is, and look beyond it. 
⁷It is given you to learn how to deny insanity, and come forth from your private world in peace. 
⁸You will see all that you denied in your brothers because you denied it in yourself. 
⁹For you will love them, and by drawing nigh unto them you will draw them to yourself, perceiving them as witnesses to the reality you share with God. 
¹⁰I am with them as I am with you, and we will draw them from their private worlds, for as we are united so would we unite with them. 
¹¹The Father welcomes all of us in gladness, and gladness is what we should offer Him. 
¹²For every Son of God is given you to whom God gave Himself.

Do not offer insanity to yourself or God. God wants to set you free from your 
insanity. You can deny insanity and look beyond it. Then you can love your 
brothers because they remind you of God. God offers himself to us all and we 
offer God to each other. We will all be one together.

8. Vision depends on light. 
²You cannot see in darkness. 
³Yet in darkness, in the private world of sleep, you see in dreams although your eyes are closed. 
⁴And it is here that what you see you made. 
⁵But let the darkness go and all you made you will no longer see, for sight of it depends upon denying vision. 
⁶Yet from denying vision it does not follow you cannot see. 
⁷But this is what denial does, for by it you accept insanity, believing you can make a private world and rule your own perception. 
⁸Yet for this, light must be excluded. ⁹Dreams disappear when light has come and you can see.
