<p id=p1>1. Do you not see that all your misery comes from the strange belief that you are powerless? 
²Being helpless is the cost of sin. 
³Helplessness is sin’s condition; the one requirement that it demands to be believed. 
⁴Only the helpless could believe in it. 
⁵Enormity has no appeal save to the little. 
⁶And only those who first believe that they are little could see attraction there. 
⁷Treachery to the Son of God is the defense of those who do not identify with him. 
⁸And you are for him or against him; either you love him or attack him, protect his unity or see him shattered and slain by your attack.</p>

²And those who see themselves as helpless must believe that they are not the Son of God. 
³What can they be except his enemy? 
⁴And what can they do but envy him his power, and by their envy make themselves afraid of it? 
⁵These are the dark ones, silent and afraid, alone and not communicating, fearful the power of the Son of God will strike them dead, and raising up their helplessness against him. 
⁶They join the army of the powerless, to wage their war of vengeance, bitterness and spite on him, to make him one with them. 
⁷Because they do not know that they <em>are</em> one with him, they know not whom they hate. 
⁸They are indeed a sorry army, each one as likely to attack his brother or turn upon himself as to remember that they thought they had a common cause.</p>

⁵Yes, it can <em>dream</em> it found an enemy, but this will shift even as it attacks, so that it runs at once to find another, and never comes to rest in victory.

²There can be no faith in sin without an enemy.

⁶Yet first he must be willing to perceive a world where it is not. 
⁷It is not necessary that he understand how he can see it. 
⁸Nor should he try. 
⁹For if he focuses on what he cannot understand, he will but emphasize his helplessness, and let sin tell him that his enemy must be himself. 
¹⁰But let him only ask himself these questions, which he must decide, to have it done for him:</p>

<blockquote>¹¹Do I desire a world I rule instead of one that rules me?<br> 
¹²Do I desire a world where I am powerful instead of helpless?<br>
¹³Do I desire a world in which I have no enemies and cannot sin?<br>
¹⁴And do I want to see what I denied because it is the truth?</blockquote>
