1. Are thoughts, then, dangerous? 
²To bodies, yes! 
³The thoughts that seem to kill are those that teach the thinker that he <em>can</em> be killed. 
⁴And so he ‘dies’ because of what he learned. 
⁵He goes from life to death, the final proof he valued the inconstant more than constancy. 
⁶Surely he thought he wanted happiness. 
⁷Yet he did not desire it <em>because</em> it was the truth, and therefore must be constant.

Thoughts are dangerous only to bodies. 
If you believe a thought that you will die, then you will die. 
By dying you value life as inconstant. 
Happiness is truth and is constant. 
By dying you did not value happiness.

2. The constancy of joy is a condition quite alien to your understanding. 
²Yet if you could even imagine what it must be, you would desire it although you understand it not. 
³The constancy of happiness has no exceptions; no change of any kind. 
⁴It is unshakable as is the Love of God for His creation. 
⁵Sure in its vision as its Creator is in what He knows, happiness looks on everything and sees it is the same. 
⁶It sees not the ephemeral, for it desires everything be like itself, and sees it so. 
⁷Nothing has power to confound its constancy, because its own desire cannot be shaken. 
⁸It comes as surely unto those who see the final question is necessary to the rest, as peace must come to those who choose to heal and not to judge.

3. Reason will tell you that you cannot ask for happiness inconstantly. 
²For if what you desire you receive, and happiness is constant, then you need ask for it but once to have it always. 
³And if you do not have it always, being what it is, you did not ask for it. 
⁴For no one fails to ask for his desire of something he believes holds out some promise of the power of giving it. 
⁵He may be wrong in what he asks, where, and of what. 
⁶Yet he will ask because desire is a request, an asking for, and made by one whom God Himself will never fail to answer. 
⁷God has already given all that he really wants. 
⁸Yet what he is uncertain of, God cannot give. 
⁹For he does not desire it while he remains uncertain, and God’s giving must be incomplete unless it is received.

You will ask for happiness when you are sure you want it. 
You receive what you desire. 
Happiness is constant.
You only need to ask for happiness once and you will have it always.
If you do not have happiness always, then you did not ask for happiness. 
If someone thinks something will make them happy, they will ask for it. 
The belief a thing will make you happy may be mistaken. 
God has already given you all that you really want. 
God gives what you are certain of wanting.
