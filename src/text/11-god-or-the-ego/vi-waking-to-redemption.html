1. It is impossible not to believe what you see, but it is equally impossible to see what you do not believe. 
²Perceptions are built up on the basis of experience, and experience leads to beliefs. 
³It is not until beliefs are fixed that perceptions stabilize. 
⁴In effect, then, what you believe you <i>do</i> see. 
⁵That is what I meant when I said, “Blessed are you who have not seen and still believe”, for those who believe in the resurrection will see it. 
⁶The resurrection is the complete triumph of Christ over the ego, not by attack but by transcendence. 
⁷For Christ does rise above the ego and all its works, and ascends to the Father and His Kingdom.

2. Would you join in the resurrection or the crucifixion? 
²Would you condemn your brothers or free them? 
³Would you transcend your prison and ascend to the Father? 
⁴These questions are all the same, and are answered together. 
⁵There has been much confusion about what perception means, because the word is used both for awareness and for the interpretation of awareness. 
⁶Yet you cannot be aware without interpretation, for what you perceive <i>is</i> your interpretation.

3. This course is perfectly clear. 
²If you do not see it clearly, it is because you are interpreting against it, and therefore do not believe it. 
³And since belief determines perception, you do not perceive what it means and therefore do not accept it. 
⁴Yet different experiences lead to different beliefs, and with them different perceptions. 
⁵For perceptions are learned <i>with</i> beliefs, and experience does teach. 
⁶I am leading you to a new kind of experience that you will become less and less willing to deny. 
⁷Learning of Christ is easy, for to perceive with Him involves no strain at all. 
⁸His perceptions are your natural awareness, and it is only the distortions you introduce that tire you. 
⁹Let the Christ in you interpret for you, and do not try to limit what you see by narrow little beliefs that are unworthy of God’s Son. 
¹⁰For until Christ comes into His Own, the Son of God will see himself as Fatherless.

5. Do not underestimate the power of the devotion of God’s Son, nor the power the god he worships has over him. 
²For he places himself at the altar of his god, whether it be the god he made or the God Who created him. 
³That is why his slavery is as complete as his freedom, for he will obey only the god he accepts. 
⁴The god of crucifixion demands that he crucify, and his worshippers obey. 
⁵In his name they crucify themselves, believing that the power of the Son of God is born of sacrifice and pain. 
⁶The God of resurrection demands nothing, for He does not will to take away. 
⁷He does not require obedience, for obedience implies submission. 
⁸He would only have you learn your will and follow it, not in the spirit of sacrifice and submission, but in the gladness of freedom.

6. Resurrection must compel your allegiance gladly, because it is the symbol of joy. 
²Its whole compelling power lies in the fact that it represents what you want to be. 
³The freedom to leave behind everything that hurts you and humbles you and frightens you cannot be thrust upon you, but it can be offered you through the grace of God. 
⁴And you can accept it by His grace, for God is gracious to His Son, accepting him without question as His Own. 
⁵Who, then, is <i>your</i> own? 
⁶The Father has given you all that is His, and He Himself is yours with them. 
⁷Guard them in their resurrection, for otherwise you will not awake in God, safely surrounded by what is yours forever.
