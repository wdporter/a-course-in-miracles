1. Anything in this world that you believe is good and valuable and worth striving for can hurt you, and will do so. 
²Not because it has the power to hurt, but just because you have denied it is but an illusion, and made it real. 
³And it is real to you. 
⁴It is not nothing. 
⁵And through its perceived reality has entered all the world of sick illusions. 
⁶All belief in sin, in power of attack, in hurt and harm, in sacrifice and death, has come to you. 
⁷For no one can make one illusion real, and still escape the rest. 
⁸For who can choose to keep the ones that he prefers, and find the safety that the truth alone can give? 
⁹Who can believe illusions are the same, and still maintain that even one is best?

striving for can hurt you, and will do so. ²Not because it [anything you 
believe is good] has the power to hurt, but just because you have denied it 
[anything you believe is good] is but an illusion, and made it [anything you 
believe is good] real. ³And it [anything you believe is good] is real to you. 
⁴It [anything you believe is good] is not nothing. ⁵And through its [anything 
you believe is good’s] perceived reality has entered all the world of sick 
illusions. ⁶All belief in sin, in power of attack, in hurt and harm, in 
sacrifice and death, has come to you. ⁷For no one can make one illusion real, 
and still escape the rest [of the illusions]. ⁸For who can choose to keep the 
ones [illusions] that he prefers, and find the safety that the truth alone can 
give? ⁹Who can believe illusions are the same, and still maintain that even

If you believe in illusions, you make them real enough to hurt you. Even one illusion can hurt you.

2. Lead not your little life in solitude, with one illusion as your only friend. 
²This is no friendship worthy of God’s Son, nor one with which he could remain content. 
³Yet God has given him a better Friend, in Whom all power in earth and Heaven rests. 
⁴The one illusion that you think is friend obscures His grace and majesty from you, and keeps His friendship and forgiveness from your welcoming embrace. 
⁵Without Him you are friendless. 
⁶Seek not another friend to take His place. 
⁷There <em>is</em> no other friend. 
⁸What God appointed has no substitute, for what illusion can replace the truth?

3. Who dwells with shadows is alone indeed, and loneliness is not the Will of God. 
²Would you allow one shadow to usurp the throne that God appointed for your Friend, if you but realized its emptiness has left yours empty and unoccupied? 
³Make no illusion friend, for if you do, it can but take the place of Him Whom God has called your Friend. 
⁴And it is He Who is your only Friend in truth. 
⁵He brings you gifts that are not of this world, and only He to Whom they have been given can make sure that you receive them. 
⁶He will place them on your throne, when you make room for Him on His.
