1. God established His relationship with you to make you happy, and nothing you do that does not share His purpose can be real. 
²The purpose God ascribed to anything is its only function. 
³Because of His reason for creating His relationship with you, the function of relationships became forever “to make happy.” 
⁴<em>And nothing else.</em> 
⁵To fulfill this function you relate to your creations as God to His.

2. In this world it is impossible to create. 
²Yet it <em>is</em> possible to make happy. 
³I have said repeatedly that the Holy Spirit would not deprive you of your special relationships, but would transform them. 
⁴And all that is meant by that is that He will restore to them the function given them by God. 
⁵The function you have given them is clearly not to make happy. 
⁶But the holy relationship shares God’s purpose, rather than aiming to make a substitute for it. 
⁷Every special relationship you have made is a substitute for God’s Will, and glorifies yours instead of His because of the illusion that they are different.

4. In a sense, the special relationship was the ego’s answer to the creation of the Holy Spirit, Who was God’s Answer to the separation. 
²For although the ego did not understand what had been created, it was aware of threat. 
³The whole defense system the ego evolved to protect the separation from the Holy Spirit was in response to the gift with which God blessed it, and by His blessing enabled it to be healed. 
⁴This blessing holds within itself the truth about everything. 
⁵And the truth is that the Holy Spirit is in close relationship with you, because in Him is your relationship with God restored to you. 
⁶The relationship with Him has never been broken, because the Holy Spirit has not been separate from anyone since the separation. 
⁷And through Him have all your holy relationships been carefully preserved, to serve God’s purpose for you.

⁴The insane protect their thought systems, but they do so insanely.

is not insane.

²The underlying basis for their effectiveness is that they offer what they defend. 
³What they defend is placed in them for safe-keeping, and as they operate they bring it to you. 
⁴Every defense operates by giving gifts, and the gift is always a miniature of the thought system the defense protects, set in a golden frame. 
⁵The frame is very elaborate, all set with jewels, and deeply carved and polished. 
⁶Its purpose is to be of value <em>in itself</em>, and to divert your attention from what it encloses.
