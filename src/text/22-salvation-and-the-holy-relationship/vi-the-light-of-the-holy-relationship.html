2. Where freedom of the body has been chosen, the mind is used as means whose value lies in its ability to contrive ways to achieve the body’s freedom. 
²Yet freedom of the body has no meaning, and so the mind is dedicated to serve illusions. 
³This is a situation so contradictory and so impossible that anyone who chooses this has no idea of what is valuable. 
⁴Yet even in this confusion, so profound it cannot be described, the Holy Spirit waits in gentle patience, as certain of the outcome as He is sure of His Creator’s Love. 
⁵He knows this mad decision was made by one as dear to His Creator as love is to itself.
